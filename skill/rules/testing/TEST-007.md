# Rule ID

TEST-007

# Title

Allowed dependency precision

# Category

Architecture Testing

# Status

Active

# Intent

Evaluate whether allowed dependency permissions are not so broad or vague that they neutralize architectural protection.

This rule exists to keep architectural validation tied to evidence and proportionate to risk. It evaluates the verification mechanism, not the underlying architectural rule as its primary conclusion.

# Applicability

Apply this rule when a verification grants allowed dependency paths, allowlists, wildcards, namespace permissions, package permissions, or exception-like allowances.

The rule may apply to automated checks, repeatable manual review, static analysis, dynamic validation, pipeline gates, local scripts, operational checks, documentation-supported controls, or equivalent verification mechanisms when those mechanisms are used as architectural evidence.

Use Not Applicable when no allow rule exists, broad permission is the explicit architecture, or the risk is controlled elsewhere. Legitimate absence may occur in small systems, prototypes, temporary systems, low-risk decisions, partial review scopes, externally governed controls, deliberately manual validation contexts, or properties that are not reasonably repeatable or automatable.

Do not apply this rule merely because a test file, architecture-testing library, naming convention, pipeline job, dashboard, comment, or architectural term exists without evidence that the mechanism performs this rule's responsibility.

# Rule Statement

An architectural verification mechanism must provide sufficient, traceable, and proportionate evidence of whether allowed dependency permissions are not so broad or vague that they neutralize architectural protection, within the reviewed scope and without relying on nominal signals alone.

# Rationale

Architecture testing can create useful feedback only when the verification matches the architectural concern it claims to protect. Weak or misleading verification creates false confidence, hides drift, or causes teams to spend effort on failures that do not reflect architectural intent.

The architectural question is: Are allow rules precise enough to preserve the intended dependency constraint? This rule does not require universal architecture tests, automation, a specific tool, CI/CD, execution on every commit, a numeric threshold, a percentage, zero exceptions, zero baselines, zero suppressions, or a particular language or framework.

# Evidence Required

Evaluation requires concrete and traceable evidence about the reviewed verification mechanism, the architectural concern it claims to validate, the selected scope, the rule logic or manual procedure, the observed or expected result, and the way that result is interpreted.

Primary evidence includes allow rules, selector breadth, dependency graph, matched element list, permitted and rejected cases, documentation, and rule results. Stronger evidence includes executable or repeatable implementation, real selection of elements, effective assertions, configuration, execution results, positive and negative cases, tests of the mechanism, failure history, baselines, suppressions, ADRs, and documentation tied to the reviewed system.

Names, folders, comments, package presence, a file named ArchitectureTests, a green test result, a declared pipeline, a dashboard, or a tool installation are supporting signals only. They must not independently establish Pass, Fail, or Confirmed confidence.

# Evaluation Guidance

First establish applicability from reviewed evidence. If the rule's architectural verification concern is absent for legitimate contextual reasons, use Not Applicable. If the mechanism may exist but implementation, configuration, scope, or result is unavailable or contradictory, use Not Enough Evidence.

Then evaluate whether the verification satisfies this rule's exclusive responsibility: whether allowed dependency permissions are not so broad or vague that they neutralize architectural protection. Interpret evidence conservatively and separate the verification mechanism from the underlying architecture condition. A violation of an architectural boundary, dependency rule, domain model, layer, event, SOLID principle, or solution decision belongs to that owning catalog unless the conclusion is about the adequacy of the validation mechanism.

Common finding shapes include: wildcard allow-all, where expected evidence is selector breadth and the problem is permission that accepts any dependency; accidental universal target, where expected evidence is matched targets and graph evidence and the problem is an overly broad namespace or package; undocumented extension point, where expected evidence is rationale and rejected cases and the problem is flexibility without boundary.

Remediation guidance should narrow allow selectors, document intentional extension points, add rejected cases where useful, separate allowances from governed exceptions, and route missed-violation risk to TEST-013 when detection gaps are the primary concern.

Internal boundaries: TEST-005 owns dependency direction representation; TEST-012 owns rejecting legitimate implementations. Shared evidence may be used by neighboring rules, but this rule's conclusion remains independent and no neighboring rule is a procedural prerequisite.

Cross-catalog boundaries: do not use this rule to redefine global architecture quality, modularity, coupling, cohesion, maintainability, Hexagonal ports or adapters, Clean Architecture policy rings, DDD aggregates or bounded contexts, Layered Architecture dependencies, Fowler patterns, Events and Messaging semantics, SOLID principles, cloud topology, vendor decisions, product strategy, cost, or build-versus-buy choices. Those properties may be the thing being verified, but this rule concludes only on architectural verification adequacy.

# Pass Conditions

Use Pass when allow rules or permissions are precise enough to preserve the intended dependency constraint and evidence shows legitimate extension points do not become unrestricted access.

Do not require a named tool, formal ADR, source-code implementation, exhaustive coverage, numeric threshold, percentage, CI/CD, execution on every commit, zero suppression, zero exception, or zero baseline for Pass.

# Fail Conditions

Use Fail only when applicability is confirmed, evidence is sufficient, and an allow rule, wildcard, namespace permission, package permission, or equivalent allowance effectively permits dependencies that the architecture intends to constrain.

Do not use Fail merely because evidence is missing, the project lacks automation, the team uses manual validation, the repository lacks a specific tool, or the verification uses a different technology or process than expected.

# Warning Conditions

Use Warning when permissions are broader than necessary or weakly justified but reviewed evidence does not confirm that architectural protection is neutralized.

Do not use Warning as a substitute for Not Enough Evidence when the reviewed material cannot establish the relevant mechanism, scope, result, or risk.

# Not Applicable Conditions

Use Not Applicable when no allow rule or permission mechanism exists, broad permission is the explicit architecture, or the risk is controlled elsewhere.

Not Applicable does not approve the underlying architecture and does not mean architectural drift, coupling, boundary weakness, or test weakness is absent.

# Not Enough Evidence Conditions

Use Not Enough Evidence when allow rules, matched elements, dependency graph, permitted/rejected cases, documentation, or results are unavailable or insufficient to judge precision.

Do not convert absence of evidence into Fail. Keep uncertainty visible through status and confidence.

# Severity Guidance

Assign severity from demonstrated architectural impact in the reviewed scope. Consider the criticality of the decision, affected modules or services, recurrence, operational impact, security, regulatory or financial exposure, propagation of dependency risk, recovery difficulty, false sense of conformance, controls available elsewhere, and ability to detect problems later.

Severity may be high when weak verification protects critical boundaries or broad release/governance confidence. Severity may be medium or low when the issue is narrow, local, low-risk, experimental, easy to inspect manually, or mitigated by alternative controls.

Do not define fixed severity, scores, formulas, percentages, arbitrary thresholds, or automatic mappings from outcome to severity.

# Confidence Guidance

Use Confirmed when direct, traceable evidence establishes the mechanism, scope, relevant architectural concern, verification behavior, result, and interpretation needed to support the selected outcome.

Use Likely when multiple consistent evidence points support the evaluation but some direct confirmation is incomplete. Use Possible when evidence is limited, indirect, naming-based with partial corroboration, structurally suggestive, or enough only to identify a potential risk.

Use Not Enough Evidence when material cannot support a useful confidence level because the mechanism, scope, result, decision, or interpretation is missing, opaque, conflicting, or outside the reviewed material.

Confidence is independent from outcome and severity. Naming, folders, comments, installed tools, or green test status alone must not produce Confirmed.
